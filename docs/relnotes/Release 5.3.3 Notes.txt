JCVS II - 5.3

This is release 5.3.3. December 18, 2002.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION

jCVS is now Java 2 "ready". Therefore, you should not have to deal with
the CLASSPATH unless you want to build jCVS.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS TO START JCVS

Change your current directory to the 'bin' directory in the jCVS
distribution that you extracted. Then, you can start jCVS with the
following commands.

Start jCVS with Java 2 with a command such as:

   java -jar jcvsii.jar

This command must be run from the bin directory, or Java will not be
able to locate the jar files.

Windows users may wish to use the Shortcut included in the bin directory.
If you wish to use this shortcut, you must edit its "Target" via the
"Properties" of the shortcut. The Target must have the path of the Java
executable (javaw.exe) as it is installed on your machine. If you are
having trouble launching jCVS, change the executable to "java.exe",
as opposed to "javaw.exe", and you will get a shell window in which
error messages will be displayed.

If you can not start jCVS with either of the two methods above, then
you can use the more traditional approach described here.

Start jCVS with command such as follows. It assumes that you are in
the bin directory of the distribution.

   CLASSPATH="jcvsii.jar;jars/activation.jar;jars/jh.jar;jars/mindbright.jar;$CLASSPATH"
   java -classpath $CLASSPATH com.ice.jcvsii.JCVS

HOWTO

* Configure Exec Viewer

  CHANGE - You can now turn off JAF in the preferences and just configure
           Exec Commands directly and be done with it. See the preference
           named 'Actions.Use JAF'.

  All "actions" are now driven by JAF. JAF uses a "mailcap" file to define
  how things are "acted upon". The default mailcap in the jcvsii.jar file
  defaults everything to 'com.ice.jcvsii.ExecViewer'. ExecViewer is a class
  that simply invoke "System.exec()" with the environment and command line
  that you supply via the configuration.

  The configuration, which is accessed via 'Actions.Exec Commands' lets
  you define "extension.action" commands. For example, if you wanted to
  have vi open your java source code, you would click the "New" button
  and enter ".java.open" (open is the default verb used when you double
  click on a file. You can change this via 'Project Window.Double Click Verb').
  This will put ".java.open" in the combo box, and select it. Now, enter
  your command line in the Command text field using "$FILE" to reference the
  file's full path name, and be sure to use double backslash if you are cursed
  with Win32. You can enter environment also as "name=value" pairs in the
  Environment field.

* Define your own mailcap file?

  jCVS, if it finds one, will read the file ~/.jcvsmailcap (~/jcvsmailcap.txt
  for Win32 folks). Use the mailcap in the doc/examples folder for a template.
  Win32 folks may wish to use the Win32Viewer, which uses the native DDE
  interface to use the verbs configured via the Windows Folder Options.
