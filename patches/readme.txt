Unzip the jcvs3.zip file to a suitable location.
Read the doc/ice-config-readme.txt for a quick and simple configuration change to get up and running.
The source will be posted here soon :-)

This release introduces a set of enhancements which make the original jCVS config packages reusable (note : jCVS functionality remains unaffected).
The original jCVS functionality (and original jCVS configuration dialog functionalities) can be invoked with the jcvsii.sh script.
A jcvs3.sh executable is under way - probably a couple of weeks from now (now = 14/3/2002) - and this will give jCVS the new configuration functionality.
You can read more about the changes in doc/ice_config_tool_improvements.html.

There are 3 other executables which demonstrate the use of the new Configurator APIs.

The software remains tested by yours truly, so ...... all the normal disclaimers ... don't use if expecting to make money and so forth :-)
Any comments ARE greatly appreciated.

Contact julian@practica.com.au if you have any queries, bugs, requests .....

enjoy !

ps: if you enjoy using winblows, then maybe you can put together the .bat files ;-)
