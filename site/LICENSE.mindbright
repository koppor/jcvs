     matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary
     to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code without

     installing or using the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license, to the extent of Licensor Applicable Patent Rights
     and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:

     You may yourself use, reproduce, display and perform Original Code solely
     for your internal R&D and/or Personal and Non-Commercial Use, provided
     that You

2.1  retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and
     other proprietary notices and disclaimers, including any warranty

2.2  You may modify, distribute and bundle Original Code, with or without
     modifications, with other software, provided that in each instance:

     (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the
         copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers, including
         any warranty disclaimer, of Licensor as they appear in the Original
         Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to
         this License and any warranty disclaimer contained in this License;

     (b) You must include a copy of this License, including procedures for
         acceptance or non-acceptance of the same, with every copy of Covered
         Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or
         impose any terms that alter or restrict this License or the
         recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6;

     (c) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the
         notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your
         Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent
         notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any
         change;

     (d) You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed modifications
         publicly available under the terms of this License, including the
         license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you
         Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of
         initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably
         distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications
         electronically (e.g. download from a web site); 

     (e) If You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only,
         You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in
         related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code
         is available under the terms of this License with information on how
         and where to obtain such Source Code;

     (f) You may not charge anything for the Program or any of the Covered
         Code, except for a reasonable handling fee and you must cause any
         code that you distribute or publish, that is work based on the
         Program, in whole or in part, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
         under the terms of this License; and

     (g) You may not distribute Covered Code as part of a commercial product
         or intended to be used together with a specific commercial product.

2.3  Notwithstanding the rights granted in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above You must
     observe the following. The Original Code contains a compression library
     ("the Library") from JCraft copyrighted under LGPL, GNU Library Public
     License. The act of running a program using the Library is not
     restricted. The Library is free software; however, redistribution and
     modification of the source code falls under the terms of the LGPL as
     published by the Free Software Foundation, also included in the source
     distribution. Accordingly, You are granted no other right to modify
     and/or redistribute the Library than already provided for by the LGPL
     license.

2.4  You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each
     Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the
     Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or
     any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or
     other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each
     Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other
     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
     hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other
     intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third
     party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered
     Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before
     distributing the Covered Code.

3    Your Grants

     In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You
     under this License:

     (a) You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive,
         royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other
         intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled
         by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and
         Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor's
         licenses under Sections 2.1 to 2.3; and 

     (b) You hereby grant to Licensor and its affiliates a non-exclusive,
         world-wide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under
         Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights
         (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce,
         display, perform, modify or have modified (for Licensor and/or its
         subsidiaries), sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any
         form, through multiple tiers of distribution.

4    Larger Works 

     Except as expressly stated herein You may create a Larger Work by
     combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this
     License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such
     instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
     fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.

5    Limitations on License 

     Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other rights, express or
     implied, are granted by Licensor herein. Other use than expressly
     permitted herein require additional commercial licenses from Licensor
     which Licensor may grant in its sole discretion. Any attempt to otherwise
     copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program or the Covered Code is
     void and will terminate Your rights under this License as provided in
     Section 12.1.

6    Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with
     the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or
     more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
     behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or
     any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such
     Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
     indemnify, defend and hold Licensor and every Contributor harmless for
     any liability incurred (including reasonable attorney's fees) by or
     claims asserted against Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any
     such Additional Terms. 

7    Versions of the License

     Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from
     time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
     number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version
     of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of
     any subsequent version of this License published by Licensor. No one
     other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

 
8    NO WARRANTY

     BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
     THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, LICENSOR AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS PROVIDE THE
     PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
     IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
     TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
     REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

9    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL LICENSOR AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
     AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
     DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
     BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
     LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
     OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
     BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

10   Trademarks

     This License does not grant any rights to use names, any other trademarks
     or trade names belonging to Licensor ("Licensor Marks") or to any
     trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks
     may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original
     Code.

11   Ownership

     Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor
     retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made
     by such Contributor. Licensor retains all rights, title and interest in
     and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of
     Licensor ("Licensor Modifications"), and such Licensor Modifications will
     not be automatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole
     discretion, choose to license such Licensor Modifications under this
     License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or
     may choose not to license them at all.

12   Termination 

12.1 Termination

     This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:

     (a) automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply
         with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within
         30 days of becoming aware of such breach, or

     (b) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time
         during the term of this License, commence any action against Licensor
         relating to the program, the Covered code or this License.

12.2 Effect of Termination

     Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use,
     reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered
     Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your
     possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have
     been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination
     of this License. Provisions which, by their nature or wording, should
     remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall so
     survive. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity
     or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in
     accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be
     without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.

13   Miscellaneous

13.1 Government End Users

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined in FAR
     2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code
     include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined
     in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and
     software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and
     12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defence purchases, DFAR
     252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights
     in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software
     Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire
     Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

13.2 Independent Development

     Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's right to acquire, license,
     develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology
     or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise
     compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that
     You may develop, produce, market or distribute.

13.3 Waiver; Construction

     Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this
     License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any
     other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language
     of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to
     this License.

13.4 Dispute Resolution

     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
     laws of Sweden, without reference to its conflicts of law provisions. The
     exclusive jurisdiction and venue for all legal actions relating to this
     Agreement shall be in courts of competent subject matter jurisdiction
     located in Sweden and You hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue.

13.5 Construction

     If conditions are imposed on You (either by court order or otherwise)
     that contradict the terms and conditions of this License, then You are
     not excused from the terms and conditions of this License.  Accordingly,
     if you cannot simultaneously satisfy the obligations under this License
     and any other obligations applicable to You, then you may not exercise
     your rights under this License.

13.6 Severability 

     If any portion of this License is held invalid or unenforceable, then the
     remaining portions of this License shall continue in full force and
     effect.

13.7 Export Laws

     You agree to comply with, and are solely responsible for complying with,
     all applicable export control laws.  You hereby agree to indemnify,
     defend and hold Licensor and every Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred (including reasonable attorney's fees) by or claims asserted
     against Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such
     non-compliance.  You may limit geographical distribution of the Covered
     Code so as to comply with any applicable export control laws.
