= Welcome To jCVS II
:toc:

Release 5.3.1, February 18, 2002.

jCVS is a Java based CVS Client. CVS is a source code control
system based on RCS. The primary benefit of CVS is that	it
provides a server/client protocol which allows clients such
as jCVS to be written. jCVS allows any Java capable machine
to be a CVS client, providing for a totally distributed source
code management system.

The
link:docs/manual/index.html[User Manual Table Of Contents]
is a good place to start. This is the same documentation
displayed by the builtin help.

For those familiar with Java, cd to `bin/` and `java -jar jcvsii.jar`.

For Windows users, there is a shortcut in the `bin/` directory. If
you edit the properties, and fix the path to the `javaw.exe`
program to match your JDK or JRE installation, then you should
be able to double-click the shortcut and launch jCVS II.

Many thanks to
Jim Kingdon,
Mister client/server protocol.

Thanks to
link:mailto:osm@interguide.com[Owen S. Medd]
for risking his disk drive to very
early releases, and knowing where to find good coffee.

We also need to pay serious homage to
link:mailto:karen@eigeneer.com[my wife]
for putting
up with 18 hour days of hacking! I can not thank my wife enough
for her understanding of
my _little programming problem_. Maybe it's time for
that twelve step program....

_Free Software! Get with the program._
